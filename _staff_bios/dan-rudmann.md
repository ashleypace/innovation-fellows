  As a freelance content strategist for the past seven years, I served a wide range of Austin startups and established brands. I recently completed a Ph.D. at UT Austin in language and literature, focused on translation and the Sanskrit epics. I am the principal director of Studium, a 501(c)(3) working to increase access to the arts and humanities.  My work in education and nonprofit sectors have underscored the importance of civic participation.
