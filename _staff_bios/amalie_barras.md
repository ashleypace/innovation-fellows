bio: |
  I love this city, I’ve loved watching it grow and change over the last seven years, and I have loved to be a part of the city/community collaboration that I’ve gotten to experience with Open Austin. I recognize that there are opportunities to make the city better from within, and I wanted to use my skills to execute on that.
