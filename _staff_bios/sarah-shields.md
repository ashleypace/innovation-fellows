bio: |
  I was interested in becoming a DTI Fellow because I thought it would be exciting to be able to contribute to change in my community.  I live in south Austin, where I have two dogs and a front yard garden. I am an active volunteer for The Seedling Foundation and Austin Regional Science Festival.
