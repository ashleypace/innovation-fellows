bio: |
  I really wanted to give back to my city in a bigger way. Working for the government was never something that my parents mentioned to me as a career option, it wasnâ€™t until SXSW 2016 when President Obama spoke about how it is our responsibility to give back in whatever capacity we can that suddenly the light bulb went off in my head. I love working in the tech industry, and I spent all my spare time So here I am!
